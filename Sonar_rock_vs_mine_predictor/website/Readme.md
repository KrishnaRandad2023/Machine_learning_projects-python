# Rock vs Mine Prediction Web App

This is a simple web application that predicts whether a given set of sonar signal features belongs to a rock or a mine. The prediction is based on a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) trained on the sonar dataset.

## Features

- **Frontend**: A web interface where users can input the 60 feature values of a sonar signal.
- **Backend**: A Flask API that processes the input and returns a prediction based on the trained Logistic Regression model.
- **Prediction**: The model will classify the input data as either a "Rock" or a "Mine".

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `joblib`
  - `Flask`

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib flask
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** (or create a new project folder and place the provided files inside).
   
2. **Train the model** (if not already trained):
   If you don't have a trained model, use the `sonar.csv` dataset to train it. The training code is included in `app.py` for reference.

3. **Run the Flask application**:
   Make sure you have Flask installed and your trained model (`Rock_vs_Mine.joblib`) in the project directory.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Web App**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You will see an input form for the 60 feature values.

5. **Make a Prediction**:
   After filling in the 60 feature values, click "Predict" to receive the model's classification of whether the input data corresponds to a "Rock" or a "Mine".

## Project Files

- **`app.py`**: The main Python script that runs the Flask application. It loads the trained model and handles predictions.
- **`index.html`**: The frontend of the web application, where users input the sonar signal features.
- **`style.css`**: Optional CSS file for styling the frontend.
- **`Rock_vs_Mine.joblib`**: The trained Logistic Regression model, saved using `joblib`.

## Model Information

The Logistic Regression model was trained using the `sonar.csv` dataset, which contains 60 features for classifying sonar signals as either rocks (R) or mines (M).

### Dataset Details:

- **Features**: 60 numeric values representing sonar signal characteristics.
- **Target**: Binary classification - "R" for Rock, "M" for Mine.

## How to Train the Model

If you wish to retrain the model, you can use the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# Load the dataset
sonar_data = pd.read_csv('sonar.csv', header=None)

# Split the data into features and target
X = sonar_data.drop(columns=60)
y = sonar_data[60]

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.1, stratify=y, random_state=1)

# Train the Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'Rock_vs_Mine.joblib')

# Evaluate the model
X_train_prediction = model.predict(X_train)
train_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_train_prediction, y_train)
print("Training accuracy:", train_accuracy)

X_test_prediction = model.predict(X_test)
test_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_test_prediction, y_test)
print("Test accuracy:", test_accuracy)
```
